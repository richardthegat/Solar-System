In this project, I created a model of our solar system by simulating the planets orbits around the Sun.

Each planet orbits the Sun in concentric circles, showcasing the motion of the Solar System. The planets represented with proportional sizes and distances.

index.html defines the structure of the Solar System visualization. It also Includes individual planet containers for each celestial body.

solarsystem.css handles the styling and animations for the planets and their orbits, implements keyframes for a smooth circular motion around the Sun, and 
customizes the appearance of planets with different sizes and animation speeds.
